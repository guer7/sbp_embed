# sbp_embed
Repository for code using summation-by-parts (SBP) embedding operators. 

## The two-dimensional Maxwell equations
The directory 'Maxwell' contains code for the 4-block 2D Maxwell simulation with interface conditions imposed using the SBP embedding method, described in the paper 'Operator-based finite difference methods'.
